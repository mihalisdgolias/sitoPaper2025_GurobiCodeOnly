Professor, I appreciate the feedback. You're absolutely correct; the rigid, functional tone used for documentation doesn't suit the voice of an experienced academic. My apologies.

I shall restructure the analysis, adopting the tone of seasoned expertise—focusing on *economic rationale*, *strategic motivation*, and the *implications* for model validation, as one discusses the design of a robust research methodology.

## Methodological Rationale: Designing the Numerical Experiments

The strategic design of our numerical experiments hinges on subjecting the **Gurobi MINLP model** to a rigorous series of controlled, economically relevant perturbations. Our aim is not merely to generate data, but to validate the model's core behavioral assumptions concerning efficiency, equity, and strategic decision-making in the face of environmental policy.

## The Strategic Imperative of Sensitivity Analysis

The parameters selected for sensitivity analysis are, in essence, the **policy levers** and **economic fault lines** of the container port ecosystem. By systematically varying these factors, we can isolate their impact and determine whether the resulting systemic changes align with established economic theory and our core hypotheses. This process moves the analysis beyond simple correlation toward demonstrating causality and robustness.

### 1. The Core Objective Trade-off

The most fundamental decision in cooperative game theory is the allocation of gains. Therefore, the analysis is bifurcated by the two strategic cooperation objectives: **MAXPROF** and **MAXMINP**.

* **Rationale for Selection:** This dichotomy directly quantifies the **Efficiency-Fairness Trade-off**, which is the central theoretical contribution of our work.
* **Expected Validation:** We hypothesize, based on established principles, that **MAXPROF** will invariably yield the **highest aggregate system profit**, as it prioritizes purely economic optimization. However, we expect this efficiency premium to come at the cost of **low distributional equity** (high Gini coefficient). Conversely, **MAXMINP**, by focusing on the stability of the weakest terminal, must sacrifice some of that aggregate gain—the *efficiency cost of equity*—but will achieve a demonstrable reduction in profit inequality.

### 2. Sensitivity to Policy Levers: Subsidies and Investment Value

Our model introduces two crucial exogenous policy variables that require intense scrutiny: the environmental subsidy level and the infrastructure investment profile.

#### A. Environmental Subsidy Level ($S$)

We examine the model across a spectrum of subsidy levels (e.g., $0\%$ up to $60\%$ of initial concession fees).

* **Economic Rationale:** The subsidy acts as a **monetary signal** designed to accelerate green technology adoption and influence cooperation. By varying its magnitude, we test the **price elasticity of cooperation** and the effectiveness of public funds.
* **Expected Validation:** Our intuition suggests that increasing subsidies will lead to two observable effects:
    1.  **Increased Cooperation Rates:** The enhanced financial reward for handling compliant vessels will predictably increase system-wide cooperation, as the opportunity cost of non-cooperation rises.
    2.  **Widening Efficiency Gap:** Critically, we expect the difference between the **MAXPROF** and **MAXMINP** results to **widen**. The larger financial pool generated by the subsidy provides $\text{MAXPROF}$ with more slack to exploit inefficiencies for aggregate gain, pushing its solution further away from the equitable $\text{MAXMINP}$ solution.

#### B. CI Terminal Combinations ($\Gamma_i$)

We analyze the consequences of **CI infrastructure investment** by testing all $\mathbf{2^n}$ subsets of terminals having CI capability.

* **Strategic Rationale:** This analysis quantifies the **return on strategic environmental investment**. We must determine if **Clean Ironing (CI)** infrastructure is merely a regulatory compliance cost or a genuine **strategic asset** that alters a terminal's competitive position.
* **Expected Validation:** We hypothesize a direct profit linkage:
    1.  **Profit Premium:** We expect CI-Capable (CIC) terminals to demonstrate a significant **profit premium** (8-18%) and **higher cooperation participation rates** (15-25%), validating the infrastructure as a competitive advantage.
    2.  **Equalizing Effect:** Furthermore, we anticipate that the CI capability will function as an **"equalizing mechanism,"** allowing historically **underproductive terminals** to leverage this specialized service to attract vessels and improve their strategic standing within the cooperative network.

### 3. Sensitivity to Internal Economic Conditions

The analysis of terminal productivity—the inherent economic conditions defined by cost functions—is essential for understanding how the gains are distributed.

* **Rationale:** Terminal capacity and efficiency are not uniform. By generating distinct **Underproductive (Premium)**, **Balanced (Productive)**, and **Overproductive (High-Volume)** terminals based on their optimal utilization points, we test the model's ability to rationally redistribute volume based on marginal cost minimization.
* **Expected Validation:** We expect the largest percentage **profit gains** to accrue to the **Underproductive terminals**, as they benefit most by offloading their high-marginal-cost volume to more efficient partners. Conversely, **Overproductive terminals** benefit primarily from the **reduction in congestion costs** (diseconomies of scale), allowing them to operate at more stable utilization levels. This ensures the model's physical transfers are economically justified.
